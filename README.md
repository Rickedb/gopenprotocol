# GOpenProtocol

> This is an Open Protocol lib for GoLang.

Still waiting for Generics in GO to continue with the project, since there will be much code rewriting when the generics feature comes out.

Generics is in the roadmap as mentioned [here](https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step), it's already available in golang playground but no official release yet.g

Probably be available in version 1.18, [check this](https://golang.org/doc/faq#generics)
